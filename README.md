# Particle-System-Visualization

This repository contains the second question ```Visualizing Swarms``` of the course ```CS 451 - Computational Intelligence``` which basically aims to develop a simulation of any of the following swarm algorithms (preferably in [Processing Language](https://processing.org/)):
* Particle Swarm Optimization
* Particle Systems
* Ant Clustering

The simulation should be able to change and set various parameter values and see their impacts on the algorithm execution and its behaviour. We choose to visualize a ```Particle System``` for our project, for which, the YouTube link can be found here: (have to add)
